# Initialize your repository

If you use GitHub to host your app repository, you can use `skeleton` as a template to initialize your own app repository. Just select `kalisio/skeleton` in the `Repository template`

![Use skeleton as template repository](./../../.vitepress/public/images/skeleton-as-template-repo.png)

You'll endup with a new repository with the `skeleton` content inside. From there, you can clone it locally and start working in it.
