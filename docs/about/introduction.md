# About

**Skeleton** is an application template based on the [Kalisio Development Kit](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/) (**KDK**). It aims at providing a basic example to setup the application server, the client build, the continuous integration and testing, as well as a documentation based on howtos to enhance the skeleton with the features you need in your application.

If you'd like more information on how this documentation is built please refer to our [development section](../guides/development/documentation.md).
